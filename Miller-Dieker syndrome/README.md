#### ABSTRACT

Classical lissencephaly (smooth brain) or generalized agyria-pachygyria is a severe brain malformation which results from an arrest of neuronal migration at 9-13 weeks gestation. It has been observed in several malformation syndromes including Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) and isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). The loss of a particular gene on chromosome 17, PAFAH1B1, is responsible for the syndrome’s characteristic sign of lissencephaly. The loss of another gene, YWHAE, in the same region of chromosome 17 increases the severity of the lissencephaly in people with Miller-Dieker Syndrome. Recent results strongly support the hypothesis of MDS as a multi-genes disorder, specifically as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome. Nevertheless, papers in literature about MDS are more focused on the phenotype of the disease, looking just at the two genes YWHAE and PAFAH1B1. 

This study wants to apply heuristic research, within the Human Interactome (HI), looking up putative disease genes – associated to Miller-Dieker syndrome – through techniques of Network Medicine. We applied classical network-based tools – such as the two clustering algorithms DiaBLE and Markov Clustering – developed to predict potential disease genes. We took advantage of the scientific knowledge acquired so far through BioGRID, one of the most informative databases of PPIs, and DisGeNET, database from which we gathered known gene disease associations (GDAs) for MDS. Details about networks and graphs were reproduced using both Cytoscape and NetworkX, on Python, as computational and graphical tools. Here we strongly suggest a biological validation – through research biology laboratories – of a list of 34 putative disease genes we found. On these genes we also performed Drug Repurposing, via DGIdb – the drug-gene interactions database.
